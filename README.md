# MediaRemoteWizard

This tool allows any application running on macOS 15.4 to access MediaRemote to obtain NowPlaying information.

After macOS 15.4, Apple added entitlement verification in the mediaremoted daemon. Clients without the corresponding entitlement will be denied access to NowPlaying information, causing applications that previously relied on this private framework to stop working, including LyricsX which I maintain.

This application injects code into mediaremoted, swapping core methods to return YES, thus allowing any client to connect.

Since code injection is required, you must disable SIP (System Integrity Protection) to use MediaRemoteWizard.

Apple Silicon must also enable arm64e_preview_abi because Apple does not allow third-party arm64e architecture apps to run by default.

```
sudo nvram boot-args=-arm64e_preview_abi
```

## Usage

After opening the application installation helper, try to keep the app running in the background to prevent mediaremoted from restarting and causing the injection to invalid.

## Security Concerns

Using this software reduces the security of your system. In future updates, we may add a whitelist feature to allow users to specify which applications can access MediaRemote, while maintaining Apple's original logic for all other applications.
